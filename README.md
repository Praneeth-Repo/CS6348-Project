# Vulnerable Login Page (No Protection)

This example demonstrates a login system that is intentionally vulnerable to **SQL Injection (SQLi)** attacks.

## Purpose

To showcase how easily login credentials can be bypassed when:
- No input sanitization is done
- No prepared statements are used

## How to Test

1. Start your Apache and MySQL (XAMPP/WAMP).
2. Ensure you have a `user` table with at least one admin user.
3. Open `login.php` in your browser.
4. Try these payloads in the **userid** field (password can be anything):
   - `admin' --`
   - `' OR 1=1 --`
   - `' OR 'a'='a`

You should be able to log in without knowing the actual password.

## Warning

This code is **not safe for production** and is only meant for academic or demo purposes to understand SQLi vulnerabilities.
